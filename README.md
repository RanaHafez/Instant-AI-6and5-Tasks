# Instant AI Session 5 and Session 6(Tasks)


# Session 5 Tasks
# 1) Examples of programming languages that do not have garbage collection and expects the developer tp allocate and deallocate explicitly:
* C
* C ++ 
* Assembly
* Fortran
## the programming languages that are having garbage collection
* Python, Java, C#


# 2) How can we improve garbage collection in OS

Garbage Collection is the automatic memory management. Memory management is the process of controlling a computerâ€™s main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory are properly managed and allocated so the OS and other applications have the memory to carry out their operations. and it strives to optimize memory usage so the cpu can efficiently access the instructions and data it needs to execute the various processes.

Memory Management operates at 3 levels hardware, operating system and program application:

at Memory Management : => OS Level 
main purpose for it is to move processes between RAM and ROM
OS:
* allocate blocks of memory to individual processes depending on the Resources of the CPU 
* decides which process will get memory resources and the will be allocated 
* and handles situations where the computer runs out of physical memory space.
